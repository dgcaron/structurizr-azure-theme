# structurizr-azure-theme
theme for decorating diagrams in structurizr with icons that match the Azure services.

## Attribution for icons
I have added the svg icons found here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/icons/. i believe this use is in line with the terms of use for these icons in the diagramming tool structurizr.  I have added the terms of use for the icons as provided by microsoft in the terms folder. if you need these icons for your own project or theme, please download the icons from the original location and agree with the terms there.
